## ðŸ“¡ Project Overview
**Smart Home Tech** is a modular event-driven platform that combines **smart home telemetry** with an integrated **e-commerce system**.  
- **Telemetry domain:** Collector, Aggregator, Analyzer â€” processing sensor events, aggregating hub snapshots, and executing user-defined automation scenarios via gRPC.  
- **Commerce domain:** Shopping Store, Shopping Cart, Warehouse, Order, Payment, Delivery â€” microservices integrated through REST + Feign with Spring Cloud Discovery and Config.  

All services communicate via **Kafka** (Avro events) or **gRPC**, persist their state in **PostgreSQL**, and are containerized with **Docker** for local and production deployments.
